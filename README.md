- 👋 Hi, I’m @XMASsLEIGHer
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code better so I can apply python to my research into black hole collisions
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a GitHub account
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solving second-order non-linear PDE's and creative ways to show the results
- 📫 I can be reached through this GitHub I think, I am still trying to figure that part out lol
